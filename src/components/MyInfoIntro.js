        Hello! My name is Wenliang Dai and I'm currently a student at the University of Nottingham,
        majored in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence. I love anything that is well-designed
        and has its impact to me. I want to become a front-end developer in the future, because it's
        interesting and challenging to tackle the logic of products and make beautiful things. If you
        want to know more about me, you're welcome to click those icons above to subscribe to my socials and blog : )
